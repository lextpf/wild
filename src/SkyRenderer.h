 * @brief Represents a single star in the night sky with twinkling animation.
 * @author Alex (https://github.com/lextpf)
 *
 * Stars are positioned in normalized sky-space coordinates (0-1) and rendered
 * at screen-space positions. Each star has independent twinkle animation
 * controlled by phase and speed parameters.
 *
 * @par Twinkle Animation
 * Brightness oscillates using a sine wave:
 * @f[
 * brightness = baseBrightness \times (0.5 + 0.5 \times \sin(time \times twinkleSpeed + twinklePhase))
 * @f]
 *
 * @par Color Variation
 * Stars have subtle color tints to simulate different star temperatures:
 * - Blue-white: Hot stars (O/B class)
 * - White: Sun-like (G class)
 * - Yellow/Orange: Cooler stars (K/M class)

 * @class SkyRenderer
 * @brief Renders atmospheric sky effects synchronized with the day/night cycle.
 * @author Alex (https://github.com/lextpf)
 *
 * The SkyRenderer creates an immersive sky atmosphere by rendering multiple
 * layered effects that respond to the current time of day. All effects are
 * rendered as screen-space overlays on top of the game world.
 *
 * @par Features
 * | Effect            | Time Active     | Description                          |
 * |-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
 * | Stars             | Night/Dusk/Dawn | Twinkling stars with color variation |
 * | Background Stars  | Night           | Dimmer distant star field            |
 * | Shooting Stars    | Night           | Random meteor streaks                |
 * | Sun Rays          | Day             | God rays from sun position           |
 * | Moon Rays         | Night           | Softer rays from moon                |
 * | Atmospheric Glow  | Always          | Soft glow around sun/moon            |
 * | Dawn Gradient     | Dawn            | Purple-to-orange sky gradient        |
 * | Dawn Horizon Glow | Dawn            | Warm glow at horizon                 |
 * | Dew Sparkles      | Morning         | Glinting ground-level sparkles       |
 *
 * @par Time Integration
 * Effects are driven by the TimeManager which provides:
 * - `GetSunArc()`: Sun position (0 at sunrise, 0.5 at noon, 1.0 at sunset)
 * - `GetMoonArc()`: Moon position for night sky
 * - `GetStarVisibility()`: Fade factor for stars (1.0 at night, 0.0 at day)
 * - `GetTimePeriod()`: Discrete time periods (Dawn, Morning, Day, etc.)
 *
 * @par Render Order
 * Effects are rendered in this order (back to front):
 * 1. Dawn gradient (full-screen color overlay)
 * 2. Dawn horizon glow (bottom of screen)
 * 3. Atmospheric glow (around sun/moon)
 * 4. Background stars (dim, distant)
 * 5. Foreground stars (bright, twinkling)
 * 6. Shooting stars (with trails)
 * 7. Dew sparkles (morning only)
 * 8. Sun/Moon rays (god rays effect)
 *
 * @par Procedural Textures
 * All textures are generated procedurally at initialization:
 * - Star texture: Soft circular gradient with glow
 * - Ray texture: Vertical gradient for light rays
 * - Glow texture: Large soft radial gradient
 *
 * @par Usage
 * @code
 * SkyRenderer sky;
 * sky.Initialize();  // Generate textures and populate star/ray arrays
 *
 * // In game loop:
 * sky.Update(deltaTime, timeManager);
 * sky.Render(renderer, timeManager, screenWidth, screenHeight);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see TimeManager, IRenderer
